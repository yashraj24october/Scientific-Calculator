User can:
* Perform arithmetic operations like `addition, subtraction, multiplication, percentage(%),factorial,power and sqrt` of numerical values..
* Perform trigonometric functions like `sin(),cos() and tan()` of any numerical value.
* Perform logrithm(`log`) of any numerical value
* Perform calculation of `complex expression `including arithmetic and logrithm functions.

* For each functionality, there is defined button in calculator interface. 
There are seperate buttons for numerical value from 0 to 9 and seperate button for arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /, %, sqrt,factorial`), trigometric functions(`sin,cos and tan`) and logrithm (log) function.
* Special toggle button for switching between Degree and radian value calculation of trigonometric functions
* There is equal (`=`) button, on clicking it, you can see your calculation result in top result box of calculator interface.

Special Features
_________
